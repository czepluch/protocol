    <h1>Protocol Berg</h1>
    <p><em>The decentralized protocol and infrastructure conference; Revision 0b11111100111.</em></p>
    <p>September 15, 2023, <a href="https://www.magazin-heeresbaeckerei.de/en/" target="_blank">

    <p><em>A <a href="https://ethberlin.ooo/decentralization/" target="_blank">Department of Decentralization</a> event.</em></p>
    <p>There are various conferences addressing end-user applications and consumer-grade products.
      However, not many of them manage to create a stage for protocol research, decentralized infrastructure,
      or core-developer experience. Protocol Berg is a novel summit to address this shortcoming by creating a one-day
      event with two parallel stages and several opportunities for technical workshops and protocol community gatherings.
      Attendance is free of charge and the event will not be influenced by sponsors or commercial vendors.</p>
    <p><em>Stay tuned for information on participation. For questions, please reach out to <a href="mailto:protocol@ethberlin.org" target="_blank">protocol@ethberlin.org</a>.</em></p>
