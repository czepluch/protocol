        <p>
          Protocol Berg is organized by the Department of Decentralization, a
          collective of people from various crypto- and blockchain communities
          in and around Berlin. The group assembled in 2018 to organize
          ETHBerlin and has been active since.
        </p>
        <p>
        We aim to be an agnostic vehicle to drive adoption, educate
        newcomers, and raise awareness of the challenges and benefits of
        decentralization and open-source software.
